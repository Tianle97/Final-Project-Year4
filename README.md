## Overview
This is a Music Player of mobile app project with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), uses [Ionic3 framework](https://ionicframework.com/), [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a database, [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform) as a cloud deploy platform, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a code editor and test execution.

## Need Components:
-  [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started)
-  [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
-  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## How to use this repository:
#### [Get started with Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started)

#### 1. Install Ionic: 
```
npm install -g ionic
```

First, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then, install the latest Ionic command-line tools in your terminal. Follow the [Android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/7.x/guide/platforms/android/) and [iOS](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/7.x/guide/platforms/ios/) platform guides to install required tools for development.(**The IOS platform must be installed**.)


2. Click Clone or Download or Copy to clipboard.
3. Enter your Terminal(for mac) or cmd(for windows), and following below:
```
# Change directory to anywhere just you like put
cd anywhere.....

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/w326004741/Final-Project-Year4.git
&
cd your folder(Final-Project-Year4)

# Enter `code .` in your terminal(open visual studio code)
```

## How to Run:
- In the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Terminal(cmd+shift+Y for Mac) Enter: `Ionic cordova ios run`.       

- Run and Test the Application Using the [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) Simulator


## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myTabs tabs
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myTabs` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
